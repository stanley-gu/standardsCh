Abstract 
========

The understanding of complex and dynamic biological networks is a large and
important challenge in biomedical science that requires the aid of software.
Over the years, many tools have been created by different research groups to
answer specific scientific questions in the field of systems biology. A
fundamental part of the scientific process is the ability to reproduce the work
of others, improve upon the body of work, and disemminate those findings to the
greater community. Disparate softwares and models of biology that are difficult
to reuse is an obstacle to research progress.This chapter describes the current
and rising standards in systems biology that facilitate data knowledge
management and physiological model exchange. In addition, software platforms
that implement these standards and enables the reuse of software code is
discussed. Finally, the range of possible computational applications is
described, highlighting the most commonly used and emerging tools in the field.
