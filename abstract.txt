Abstract
========

With the sequencing of the human genome, it has become apparent that
Systems Biology, the understanding of cellular networks through
dynamical analysis is becoming an important part of research for
mainstream biologists. One of the indicative trends to emerge in recent
years is the development of model interchange standards that permit
biologists to easily exchange dynamical models between different
software tools. In this chapter two chief model exchange standards, SBML
and CellML are described. In addition, the development of extensible
software frameworks, including SBW, BioSPICE and BioUML are discussed
and the role they might play in stimulating the development of new tools
and approaches. Finally, the range of possible computational
applications is described, highlighting the rich set of tools that is
emerging as systems biology becomes a mainstream science.
