  abstract = {BACKGROUND:We propose that a computerized, internet-based graphical
	description language for systems biology will be essential for describing,
	archiving and analyzing complex problems of biological function in
	health and disease.RESULTS:We outline here a conceptual basis for
	designing such a language and describe BioD, a prototype language
	that we have used to explore the utility and feasibility of this
	approach to functional biology. Using example models, we demonstrate
	that a rather limited lexicon of icons and arrows suffices to describe
	complex cell-biological systems as discrete models that can be posted
	and linked on the internet.CONCLUSIONS:Given available computer and
	internet technology, BioD may be implemented as an extensible, multidisciplinary
	language that can be used to archive functional systems knowledge
	and be extended to support both qualitative and quantitative functional
	analysis.},

	form of a diagram, map, and/or database. A diagram convention was
	designed capable of unambiguous representation of networks containing
	multiprotein complexes, protein modifications, and enzymes that are
	substrates of other enzymes. To facilitate linkage to a database,
	each molecular species is symbolically represented only once in each
	diagram. Molecular species can be located on the map by means of
	indexed grid coordinates. Each interaction is referenced to an annotation
	list where pertinent information and references can be found. Parts
	of the network are grouped into functional subsystems. The map shows
	how multiprotein complexes could assemble and function at gene promoter
	sites and at sites of DNA damage. It also portrays the richness of
	connections between the p53-Mdm2 subsystem and other parts of the
	network.},
